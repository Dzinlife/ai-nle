## Working agreements

- Prefer `pnpm` when installing dependencies.
- Keep it simple - don't add unnecessary entities.
- Refactor frequently to maintain simplicity.
- Write comments in Chinese.
- Use `const getValue = useEffectEvent(() => value)` instead of using `useRef` with manual value assignment for cleaner, simpler code.
